# Client Management System

## Overview
This is a simple Client Management System that allows users to perform ARUD (ADD, Read, Update, Delete) operations on client records. The system stores client data such as account number, pin code, name, phone number, and account balance. All records are stored in a text file clients.txt.

## Features:
- Show Client List: Displays all client details in a tabular format.
- Add New Client: Allows users to add new client records.
- Delete Client: Allows users to delete client records by account number.
- Update Client Info: Enables updating a client's details (pin code, name, phone number, account balance).
- Find Client: Allows searching for a client using their account number.
- Exit: Exits the program.

## Program Extension 2

The program has been extended to include a "Manage User" option in the main menu, which provides the following actions: show user list, add user, show user details, delete user, update user, and return to the main menu.

Upon starting the program, it prompts for login credentials. The admin user has full permissions, and new users can be added with either full or limited permissions. When adding new users, the program will prompt for the desired permissions to assign.

When logging in with any user account, the program will check the user's permissions before allowing any action. If the user does not have the necessary permissions, access will be denied.
