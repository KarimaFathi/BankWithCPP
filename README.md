# Client Management System

## Overview
This is a simple Client Management System that allows users to perform ARUD (ADD, Read, Update, Delete) operations on client records. The system stores client data such as account number, pin code, name, phone number, and account balance. All records are stored in a text file clients.txt.

## Features:
- Show Client List: Displays all client details in a tabular format.
- Add New Client: Allows users to add new client records.
- Delete Client: Allows users to delete client records by account number.
- Update Client Info: Enables updating a client's details (pin code, name, phone number, account balance).
- Find Client: Allows searching for a client using their account number.
- Exit: Exits the program.
